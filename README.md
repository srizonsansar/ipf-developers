## My Experience
- the design was very good and I like it a lot. Working with this design was challenging and fun also. Challenging in the sense I have to use tricky html, css and jquery
- html, css, jquery is same and the code used in site is good, developer can work easily, well you might have some feedback because different people and organizations have their own style of working
- I am working without documentation, so... if I have proper documentation especially on desktop nav and mobile nav, it would have been more easy. But you have already mentioned its a test project for me. From this code you can judge me, but still if i have done some wrong on clicks then please let me know, I can correct
